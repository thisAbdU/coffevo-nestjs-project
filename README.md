Coffevo NestJS project
=====

This repository is an example application for the [NestJS framework](https://nestjs.com/) in Typescript that exposes a REST API and interacts with both [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The project covers a wide range of topics such as creating controllers, services, entities, data transfer objects, handling request and response data, error handling, input data validation, configuration management, middleware, guards, interceptors, testing, creating a Mongoose model, using it to access MongoDB, adding pagination, and implementing transactions.


Topics
---

This repository has two branches: `main` and `mongodb`. 
The `main` branch focuses on developing a web application using the NestJS framework with a particular emphasis on creating controllers, services, entities, and data transfer objects. It also covers a wide range of other topics such as handling request and response data, error handling, input data validation, configuration management, middleware, guards, interceptors, authentication, and testing. Furthermore it provides a solid foundation for building a robust and scalable web application using NestJS, which is a popular Node.js framework for building server-side applications.
The `mongodb` branch is primarily focused on implementing MongoDB functionalities and covers topics such as creating a Mongoose model, using it to access MongoDB, adding pagination, and implementing transactions. It also covers adding indexes to schemas for better performance.

Getting Started
---

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/vittorioexp/NestJS-project-example.git

cd NestJS-project-example

docker-compose up -d

npm install
```

Then rename the `.env.template` file to `.env` and, if necessary, edit it.

To run the application, use the following command:
```
npm run start:dev
```
This will start the application in development mode with hot reloading enabled.

Then connect to the database and enter the following SQL statements to create one admin, one user, and a two coffees:
```
insert into "user" ("username", "password", "role") values ('admin', '60fe74406e7f353ed979f350f2fbb6a2e8690a5fa7d1b0c32983d1d8b3f95f67', 'admin');
insert into "user" ("username", "password", "role") values ('user', 'bd5cf8347e036cabe6cd37323186a02ef6c3589d19daaee31eeb2ae3b1507ebe', 'user');

insert into "coffee" ("name", "brand", "inventorId") values ('star trucks coffee', 'star trucks ltd', 1);
insert into "coffee" ("name", "brand", "inventorId") values ('cheap coffee', 'cheap ltd', 2);
```
Now you're ready to hit the endpoints of the application!



Endpoints
---

The REST API is about coffees and includes a few endpoints. Some examples follow.

### User registration
```
POST http://localhost:3000/v1/registration/do

{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "User1234"
}
This will return an authorization token.
```

### Login
```
POST http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/login
with JSON data in the request body:
{
    "username": "user",
    "password": "User1234"
}
or
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "Admin1234"
}
This will return an authorization token.
```

### Get profile info
```
GET http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/profile
with authorization token.
```

### Get the list of coffees
```
GET http://localhost:3000/v1/coffees?limit={limit}&offset={offset}

```

### Get a coffee
```
GET http://localhost:3000/v1/coffees/{id}
with authorization token.
```

### Create a coffee
```
POST http://localhost:3000/v1/coffees/
